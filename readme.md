Goal: Create a game where letters appear on the screen

They should be listed with the capital first then lower case  
ie: "Aa", "Bb", "Cc"

You can tap on a letter to hear its name  
When tapped on it should draw attention to the letter somehow  
and also prevent other letters from being pressed for a moment  
When all have been pressed, it should reset and randomize

Do the same thing for numbers 1 to 10
